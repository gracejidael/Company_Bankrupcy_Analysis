Introduction to Company Bankruptcy Prediction
Predicting bankruptcy is a critical task in the financial world. Companies often face numerous challenges, and understanding which factors signal financial distress can help stakeholders act early and make better decisions.

This project uses financial data and machine learning to build a model that can predict the likelihood of a company going bankrupt. By uncovering the key financial metrics that matter, this analysis aims to provide practical insights for reducing risk and improving decision-making.

What We’re Trying to Achieve
Here’s what this analysis sets out to do:

Get to Know the Data: Take a close look at the dataset to understand its structure, spot any issues, and identify patterns or relationships.
Prepare the Data: Clean and process the data to make it ready for modeling. This includes handling missing values, balancing classes, and standardizing feature scales.
Build and Test Models: Train several machine learning models to see which one predicts bankruptcy most accurately.
Understand the Results: Analyze which financial metrics are the most important predictors and evaluate how well the models perform.
Share Actionable Insights: Provide clear recommendations based on the findings to help users of the model make informed decisions.
How We’ll Do It
This project is broken into six main steps:

Explore the Data:
Load and inspect the dataset to see what we’re working with.
Use charts and graphs to look for trends, patterns, and relationships between variables.
Clean and Prepare the Data:
Fix any missing or inconsistent data.
Use SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to address imbalanced classes so the model learns effectively.
Standardize the data to ensure all features are on the same scale.
Select and Train Models:
Try out different machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM.
Use hyperparameter tuning to fine-tune the models and get the best results.
Evaluate the Models:
Measure performance using metrics like accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision, and recall.
Visualize the results with confusion matrices, learning curves, and feature importance plots.
Analyze Key Features:
Identify which financial indicators are driving the predictions and see how they connect to the outcomes.
Summarize and Recommend:
Highlight the key takeaways and recommend the best model for practical use.
Why It’s Important
This analysis helps us answer questions like:

What are the warning signs of financial trouble for a company?
How can we better assess the financial health of companies?
What’s the most reliable way to predict bankruptcy using data?
By answering these questions, we aim to provide tools and insights that can help stakeholders make smarter, more informed decisions.

The purpose of this research notebook is to create a machine learning model using “Company_House_Info” data that helps to predict the company’s success or bankruptcy based on the following attributes:
